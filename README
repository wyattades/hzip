This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner:  Wyatt Ades (wades@ucsc.edu)
Partner:  Lee White (lnwhite@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Wyatt Ades spent      22 hours working alone.
Lee White spent       10 hours working alone.
We spent              25 hours working together.
Wyatt Ades spent      15 hours driving.
Lee White spent       10 hours driving.
